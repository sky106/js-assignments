    <h1> DataTypes in Javascript</h1>

    <p> - A value in JavaScript is always of a certain type. For example, a string or a number.
        <br/> - here are eight basic data types in JavaScript. Here, we’ll cover them in general and in the next chapters we’ll talk about each of them in detail.</p>

    <h2>1. number</h2>
    <p> - The number type represents both integer and floating point numbers.
        <br/> - There are many operations for numbers, e.g. multiplication *, division /, addition +, subtraction -, and so on.</p>

    <h2>2. bigint</h2>
    <p> - In JavaScript, the “number” type cannot represent integer values larger than (2<sup>53</sup>-1) (that’s   9007199254740991), or less than -(-2<sup>53</sup>-1) for negatives. <br/> - It’s a technical limitation caused by their internal representation.
        <br/> - For most purposes that’s quite enough, but sometimes we need really big numbers, e.g. for cryptography or microsecond-precision timestamps.
        <br/> - BigInt type was recently added to the language to represent integers of arbitrary length.  
        A BigInt value is created by appending n to the end of an integer.</p>
    

    <h2>3. string</h2>
    <p> - A string in JavaScript must be surrounded by quotes. <br/> - In JavaScript, there are 3 types of quotes.
        <ol>1. Double quotes: "Hello".</ol>
        <ol>2. Single quotes: 'Hello'.</ol>
        <ol>3. Backticks: `Hello`.</ol>
        <br/> - Double and single quotes are “simple” quotes. There’s practically no difference between them in JavaScript. 
        <br/> - Backticks are “extended functionality” quotes. They allow us to embed variables and expressions into a string by wrapping them in ${…}. 
        <br/> - The expression inside ${…} is evaluated and the result becomes a part of the string. 
        <br/> - We can put anything in there: a variable like name or an arithmetical expression like 1 + 2 or something more complex.</p>

    <h2>4. boolean</h2>
    <p> - The boolean type has only two values: true and false.
        <br/> - This type is commonly used to store yes/no values: true means “yes, correct”, and false means “no, incorrect”.
        <br/> - Boolean values also come as a result of comparisons. </p>

    <h2>5. null</h2>
    <p> - The special null value does not belong to any of the types described above.
        <br/> - It forms a separate type of its own which contains only the null value.
        <br/> - In JavaScript, null is not a “reference to a non-existing object” or a “null pointer” like in some other languages.
        <br/> - It’s just a special value which represents “nothing”, “empty” or “value unknown”.</p>

    <h2>6. undefined</h2>
    <p> - The special value undefined also stands apart. It makes a type of its own, just like null.
        <br/> - The meaning of undefined is “value is not assigned”.
        <br/> - If a variable is declared, but not assigned, then its value is undefined. 
        <br/> - Technically, it is possible to explicitly assign undefined to a variable…But we don’t recommend doing that.
        <br/> - Normally, one uses null to assign an “empty” or “unknown” value to a variable, while undefined is reserved as a default initial value for unassigned things.</p>

    
    <h2>7. object</h2>
    <p> - The object type is special.
        <br/> - All other types are called “primitive” because their values can contain only a single thing (be it a string or a number or whatever). 
        <br/> - In contrast, objects are used to store collections of data and more complex entities.
        <br/> - Being that important, objects deserve a special treatment. We’ll deal with them later in the chapter Objects, after we learn more about primitives.</p>

    <h2>8. symbol</h2>
    <p> - The symbol type is used to create unique identifiers for objects. 
        <br/> - We have to mention it here for the sake of completeness, but also postpone the details till we know objects.</p>
