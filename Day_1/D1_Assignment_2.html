    <h2>Difference between var , let and const</h2>

    <h3>var - </h3>
    <p> - The scope of a variable defined with the keyword “var” is limited to the “function” within which it is defined.
    <br/> - If it is defined outside any function, the scope of the variable is global.
        var is “function scoped”.
    </p>

    <h3>let - </h3>
    <p> - The scope of a variable defined with the keyword “let” or “const” is limited to the “block” defined by curly braces i.e. {} .
    <br/> - “let” and “const” are“block scoped”.
    </p>
    
    <h3>const - </h3>
    <p> - The scope of a variable defined with the keyword “const” is limited to the block defined by curly braces. <br/> - However if a variable is defined with keyword const, it cannot be reassigned.
        “const” cannot be re-assigned to a new value. However it CAN be mutated.
    </p>

    <h3>
        <mark>var variables can be updated and re-declared within its scope; <br/>let variables can be updated but not re-declared; <br/>const variables can neither be updated nor re-declared.</mark>
    </h3>
