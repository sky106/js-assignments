    <!-- 
    An integer number greater than 1 is called a prime if it cannot be divided without a remainder by anything
    except 1 and itself.
    In other words, n > 1 is a prime if it canâ€™t be evenly divided by anything except 1 and n.
    For example, 5 is a prime, because it cannot be divided without a remainder by 2, 3 and 4.
    Write the code which outputs prime numbers in the interval from 2 to n.
    For n = 10 the result will be 2,3,5,7.
    P.S. The code should work for any n, not be hard-tuned for any fixed value
